# sheep_game
The white sheep starts by rolling the dice.

If it gets a cloverleaf, it can roll again as many times as the player wants.
However, it must return to where it was at the beginning of the turn if the player rolls a wolf.
To end the turn without rolling a wolf, you can press Done.

The sheep that reaches the finish line first wins the game.
